                        <p>Nathan is the founder and the director of SEEDnet. During his years as the youth pastor at
                            Ashland Grace in Ohio, the Lord led Nathan and some teens to a low-income apartment complex
                            in Ashland to do "church" with the many kids wandering around. Through that, Nathan then
                            gathered adults for an evangelistic Bible study, which was the beginning of EastGate Bible
                            Church, Nathan's first church plant in 2006.</p>
                        <p> Since then, Nathan has felt passionate about planting and multiplying churches in
                            low-income, (S.E.E.D.) oppressed areas. Nathan believes that proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus
                            to unbelievers is the key to starting new churches.</p>
                        <p>Nathan and his wife, Jena, have written a workbook entitled, Gospeling: A Personal Guide To
                            Sharing The Gospel to empower all Christians to verbalize the Good News. They live with
                            their three crazy boys in rural Ashland with their dogs, sheep, chickens, and horse.</p>
